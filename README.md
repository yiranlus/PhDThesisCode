# PhD Thesis Code

This repository contains most of the code that is used in my thesis.

* `immunohistochemistry`: contains the simulation, the reconstruction and aberration analysis of the image simulation `immunohistochemistry`.
* `MFM`: contains the simulation, the reconstruction and aberration analysis of the image simulation `MFM`.
* `WSe2 Experiment`: contains the simulation, the reconstruction and aberration analysis on the simulated data using WSe$_2$.
* `WSe2 Experiment`: contains the reconstruction and aberration analysis on the WSe$_2$ experiment data.
* `Diffraction Pattern Recovery`: contains the code that used to compare the diffraction pattern and object function from simulation and the reconstruction.
